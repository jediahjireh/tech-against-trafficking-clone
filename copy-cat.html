                        There are an estimated 50 million people worldwide subjected to some form of modern slavery.
                        Given
                        the
                        widespread nature of this
                        crime and the complexity of tackling it, increased engagement from all stakeholders, including
                        and
                        especially the private sector, is vital.

                        Through their expertise, capacity for innovation, and global reach, technology companies can
                        play a
                        major role in preventing and disrupting human trafficking and in empowering survivors. Digital

                        this

                Technological solutions to date include mobile apps that help identify victims of sex trafficking;

                there are many more tools out there in need of support. Tech Against Trafficking hopes to accelerate the
