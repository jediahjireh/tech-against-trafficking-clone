# tech-against-trafficking-cloned-webpage
This project is a recreation of the Tech Against Trafficking homepage, serving as a tribute to the important work being done in the fight against human-trafficking and the necessity of using technology-driven solutions to combat this global crime. It showcases my skills in HTML and SCSS, while emphasising a meticulous attention to detail.
